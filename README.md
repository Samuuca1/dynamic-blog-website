1. **Git and GitHub for Version Control**: Use Git to manage changes and GitHub to host the project repository.
2. **CRUD Operations**: Implement the ability to create, read, update, and delete blog posts.
3. **JavaScript Local Storage**: Store and retrieve blog post data from the browser's local storage.
4. **Responsive Design**: Ensure the blog website is responsive on different devices.
